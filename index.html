    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 15, 2025</p>

    <p>Ibanmatik is a simple utility app designed to help users quickly identify bank information based on IBAN numbers. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how your data is (or is not) collected and handled.</p>

    <p>Ibanmatik does not collect or process any form of payment information such as credit card numbers, bank account details, or similar financial data. The app does not include any in-app purchases or payment processing features.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Ibanmatik uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads within the app. Google AdMob may collect certain data from your device, such as:

        <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
