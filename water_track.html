        <h1>Water Track Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 19, 2025</p>

        <p>This privacy policy describes how Barış Demirci ("I", "me", or "my") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of the Water Track ("App") mobile application.</p>

        <p>By downloading or using the App, you agree to the practices described in this privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>I collect certain information to provide a better service to you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information You Provide (Optional):</strong> You may choose to enter information such as your weight or activity level for the App's core functionality (e.g., to calculate your daily water goal). This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to my servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Information Collected Automatically (Usage Data):</strong> When you use the App, I may collect anonymized technical data, such as crash logs, in-app interactions, device model, operating system version, and advertising identifiers (IDFA or Google Advertising ID).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>I use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To Provide App Functionality: To allow you to track your daily water consumption and manage your goals.</li>
            <li>To Improve My Services: To analyze how the App is used, fix bugs, and enhance the user experience.</li>
            <li>To Display Advertisements: To show relevant ads through third-party advertising networks (See Section 3).</li>
            <li>To Process In-App Purchases: To offer premium features, such as removing ads, and to manage your purchases.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services and Data Sharing</h2>

        <p>I use third-party service providers to support the functionality of the App:</p>

        <h3>a) Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>Water Track uses Google AdMob to serve advertisements. AdMob may collect data, such as your device's advertising ID, to serve you personalized ads. You can find more information about how Google uses data on Google's Privacy & Terms page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>
        <p>Users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK may be presented with a choice between personalized and non-personalized ads.</p>

        <h3>b) In-App Purchases (Apple App Store)</h3>
        <p>My App offers in-app purchases, such as a "Remove Ads" option. All payment transactions are managed and processed directly by Apple (App Store). Your credit card information or payment details are not collected or stored by me.</p>

        <h2>4. In-App Purchase (Remove Ads)</h2>

        <p>If you choose to purchase the "Remove Ads" package within the App, I will stop displaying advertisements from Google AdMob and other third-party ad networks once this purchase is complete. This purchase is a one-time transaction managed through your Apple account.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

        <p>I take reasonable technical and administrative measures to secure your information. However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>My App is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction). I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>I may update this privacy policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Me</h2>
